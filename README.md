# Math CAPTCHA (Client-Side)

Nowadays, due to the presence of CAPTCHA-reading scripts, it is no longer effective to combat bots using jumbled letters and numbers. Many free scripts can easily recognize traditional CAPTCHAs.

Math CAPTCHA is a simple solution to maintain security against bots, and this project provides a basic example with the necessary code.

This sample is suitable for projects that require a local, client-side CAPTCHA for applications.
